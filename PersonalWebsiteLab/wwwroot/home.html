        <h2>HomeTown</h2>
        <p>I grew up in Trenton,Mi but I curretnly live in Dearborn Heights, MI. I love where I live. All the neighbors are super nice and tons of fantastic places to go and eat. Lots of life happening around here with an amazing downtown adn the fact that I am a 4 min drive from the highway makes living here even better giving me a 20min commute to work.</p>
