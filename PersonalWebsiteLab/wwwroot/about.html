        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I play lots of world of warcraft, some would say too much. I love the game but the current version is so bad. Luckily they have re-released the older versions and I get to play them again which I am having the time of my life on.</p>
        <h3>I also do professional stuff. Add me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacob-garcia-b48083108/">Linked-In</a></h3>
        <p>I do not have otherp professional social media, I stream on twitch and I do not thin that I should put that in here. Check out my <a href="portfolio.html">Portfolio</a> to see cool coding projects I've done</p>
